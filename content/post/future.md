Game modes will eventually rotate on a continuous playlist, but weâ€™re playing Time Attack on repeat for now. More modes will be added over time, like Survival--fighting to survive the longest by sending garbage blocks at other players--Team Deathmatch--dividing into teams to take on the world--and Puzzle Dash--scoring points by solving a never-ending series of block-matching challenges.
